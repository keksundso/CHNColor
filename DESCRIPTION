Description: Simple wrapper to create a list of most distinguishable colors of length n. For small n, it uses the color list from Sasha Trubetskoy (https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors/). For more colors it falls back to random color sampling. If wanted it can also create colorgradients, by utilizing colorRamps.
